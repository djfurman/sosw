`sosw` = Serverless Orchestrator of Serverless Workers

`sosw` is a set of tools for orchestrating **asynchronous** invocations of AWS Lambda Workers.

`sosw` requires you to implement/deploy several Lambda functions (Essentials) using the following core classes:

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   orchestrator
   scheduler
   scavenger
   worker_assistant

The **Worker** functions themselves are expected to call the WorkerAssistant when completed the task
from each invocation. If you inherit the :ref:`Worker` class in your function the ``__call__`` method
does that automatically. And there are several other common features that Worker class provides
(statistic aggregator, components initialisation, configuration automatic assembling and more...)

Another deployment requirement is to create several `DynamoDB` tables:

- ``sosw_tasks``
- ``sosw_retry_tasks``
- ``sosw_closed_tasks``

| You can find the Cloudformation template for the databases in `the example`_.
| If you are not familiar with CloudFormation, we highly recommend at least learning the basics from `the tutorial`_.
